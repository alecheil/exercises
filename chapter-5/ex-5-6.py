# Programming Exercise 5-6
#
# Program to compute calories from fat and carbohydrate.
# This program accepts fat grams and carbohydrate grams consumed from a user,
# uses global constants to calculate the fat calories and carb calories,
# then passes them to a function for formatted display on the screen.


# Global constants for fat calories per gram and carb calories per gram
FAT_CAL = 0.0
CARB_CAL = 0.0


# define the main function
def main():
    # Define local float variables for grams of fat, grams of carbs, calories from fat,
    # and calories from carbs
    fat_grams = float()
    carb_grams = float()
    fat_cal = float()
    carb_cal = flaot()

    # Get grams of fat from the user.
    fat_grams = input("enter grams of fat per gram")

    # Get grams of carbs from the user.
    carb_grams = input("enter grams of carbs per gram")

    # Calculate calories from fat.
    fat_cal = 

    # Calculate calories from carbs.


    # Call the display calorie detail function, passing grams of fat, grams of carbs,
    # calories from fat and calories from carbs as arguments



# Define a function to display calorie detail.
# This function accepts grams of fat, grams of carbs, calories from fat,
# and calories from carbs as parameters,
# performs no calculations,
# but displays this information formatted for the user.

	# print each piece of information with floats formatted to 2 decimal places.



# Call the main function to start the program
